# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
University project for the course Data Science Lab, academic year 2021/2022, Winter session. 
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset which contains roughly 300k labeled tweets, together with other features such as username, date and time of the tweet. Unfortunately, the data will not be provided in this repository since it is part of the teaching material and it is therefore intended to be available for PoliTo students only. A complete report of this project is presented in .pdf format in this repository.
Special thanks to [Matteo Matteotti](https://github.com/mttmtt31) for collaborating with me on this project!
